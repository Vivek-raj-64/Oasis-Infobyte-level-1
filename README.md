# Oasis-Infobyte-level-1

I have uploaded the tasks assigned to me during my Web Development internship with Oasis Infobyte. I have choses to do the tasks of level 1 which include:

1) A landing page: I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the landing page of a gym website.

2) Portfolio Website: I have used the same tools to create this one too. This is a very long and most creative project. I have included all my other project links in this website. Links to all my social media platforms have also been included. This website is a responsive one and adapts to the screen size whether you are using a desktop, table or a mobile phone.

3) Temperature Converter: Javascript has been used intensively in this one. This app converts the temperature from degree celcius to degree farenheit and vice versa. It only accepts numeric data. If the field is empty it alerts the user to fill in a temperature to convert. It also has a reset button to clear all fields.
